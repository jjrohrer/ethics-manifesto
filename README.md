# Ethics Manifesto

**A practical framework for applied ethics across professions.**

This is a seed—an invitation to think clearly about ethics in business, technology, politics, and beyond. It's intentionally incomplete. The goal isn't to hand down answers, but to start a usable conversation.

## What This Is

Most ethics discussions stay abstract. This project aims for something different: a framework that practitioners can actually use—one that helps people in real roles make better decisions.

We're starting with:
- **Characteristics of a good ethics framework** — what should any practical ethics approach actually do?
- **Profession-specific applications** — how does this play out in business, IT, politics?

## Why "Manifesto"?

Because this is a statement of intent, not a finished system. A manifesto says: *here's what we believe matters, and here's a starting point.* It's meant to be argued with, forked, and improved.
