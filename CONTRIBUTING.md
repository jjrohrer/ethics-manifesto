## Guidelines

**Be practical.** Abstract ethics discussions are everywhere. We're trying to build something people can actually use.

**Be clear.** Jargon excludes people. Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague outside your field.

**Be constructive.** Disagree with ideas, but engage with them seriously.

**Credit sources.** If you're drawing on existing frameworks or thinkers, cite them.

## What We're Looking For

Right now, the biggest needs are:

1. **Refinement of the core framework** - Are the characteristics of a good ethics framework actually the right ones?

2. **Profession-specific expertise** - How does this apply in your field? What's missing?

3. **Edge cases and stress tests** - Where does this framework break down? What hard cases should it address?

4. **The License for _this_** - Licenses are tricky: What should we do to keep this seed from being turning against us?

5. **Platform Expertise** - We're starting on GitHub.com. What is best-practice for scaling communities like ours?

6. **Design** - Let's make this site prettier, more inviting, more accessible.
