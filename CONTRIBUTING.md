# Contribs of a Good Ethics Framework

**What should a practical ethics framework actually do?**

## Overview

Before diving into specific professions or situations, we need to ask: what makes an ethics framework *good*? Not good in the abstract—good in practice. Something people will actually use.

This page outlines the characteristics we think matter. These are open for debate.

## Shepherding Principles
* Start with kindness
* Tough minded, tender hearted

## The Characteristics

**In vs. Out:** Clear articulation of who is included in this, and who is outside.

**More responsibility vs. Less responsibility** Clearly defining a hierarchy of responsibility. Who, for example, should be held to a higher standard.

**1. Actionable**
It should help people make decisions, not just think about them.

**2. Accessible & Democratic**
It shouldn't require a philosophy degree to understand or apply. Likewise, this isn't just for your boss to contemplate - everyone in the field should know what is happening and their role in this.  "Just following orders" wasn't acceptable in 1945, so it is definitely not acceptable today.

**3. Honest about tradeoffs**
Real ethical decisions involve competing goods. A useful framework acknowledges this.

**4. Scalable**
It should work for individual decisions and organizational policy.

**5. Testable**
You should be able to ask: "Did applying this lead to better outcomes?"

**5. Consequential**
How do we hold each other accountable? Words are cheap, so let's be explicit about what should happen to rule breakers, but also the role everyone else plays in enforcing our standards.

**6. Clear Vision**
What does the ideal future look like?

**7. Clear Mission**
Critically, this tells everyone what is in-bounds, what is out of bounds.

- What's missing from this list?
- Are any of these in tension with each other?
- How do we weight these when they conflict?
